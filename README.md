# Flatiron School Phase-1 Project: Multiversus Ironman Randomizer

### Overview
* Multiversus is Multiplayer Fighting Game Platformer.  In pursuit of personal glory, players will pursue the completion of challenges of their own making.  One of the more common challenges players attempt is the Ironman Challenge.  The objective of the Ironman is to win with every playable character before losing a single game.  Due to the difficulty of this endeavor, players will often fail this challenge many times before a successful completion.  This application will allow users to randomly select a fighter for their next battle, which can break up the monotony of repetitive attempts.
